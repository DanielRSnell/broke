## Project Overview

- Proper heading hierarchy
- Accessible data tables

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio answers the question every hiring manager asks: "Can you drive growth?" It does this through:

1. **Numbers over narratives** - Every claim backed by data
2. **Process transparency** - Showing methodology builds trust
3. **Framework thinking** - Demonstrates systematic approach
4. **Tool proficiency** - Signals hands-on experience
5. **Business context** - Growth means different things; context matters

The design is clean and professional without being corporate. It signals analytical thinking through data-heavy sections while maintaining visual appeal through thoughtful typography and whitespace.

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- Growth marketers transitioning between companies
- Freelance growth consultants pitching retainers
- Product marketers showcasing PLG success
- Content marketers proving SEO impact
- Performance marketers demonstrating ad efficiency
- CRO specialists showing optimization wins

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Modern HTML5 with semantic markup
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid customization
- **Charts**: Chart.js or Recharts for interactive data viz
- **Icons**: Lucide or Heroicons
- **Fonts**: Inter or Geist for modern professional feel
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for subtle microinteractions

## Conversion Goals

This portfolio converts by:

1. **Establishing credibility** through specific metrics and tools
2. **Demonstrating ROI** with clear before/after comparisons
3. **Showing versatility** across multiple growth channels
4. **Proving systematic thinking** through documented processes
5. **Building confidence** with transparent methodology

The layout encourages visitors to explore multiple case studies, each reinforcing the narrative of consistent, data-driven growth. Multiple strategic CTAs (contact, schedule call, download case study) provide easy next steps without being pushy.

## Strategic Positioning

This portfolio positions the owner as:
- **Data-driven**: Every decision backed by metrics
- **Experimental**: Comfortable with testing and iteration
- **Business-focused**: Growth tied to revenue, not vanity metrics
- **Technical**: Capable with analytics tools and platforms
- **Strategic**: Thinking beyond tactics to long-term growth

The result is a portfolio that appeals to both technical evaluators (who appreciate methodology) and business decision-makers (who care about ROI), making it effective for both employment and consulting opportunities.
